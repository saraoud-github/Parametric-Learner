# Parametric-Learner

To view the entire project, kindly run "ProjectIImainGUI.py". This will prompt an interface to open up, where you can upload an image and it will be classified as Old or Young, using the user's choice of features and classification algorithm.

The features include: Facial Landmark Ratios and Edge-Detected Images.

The classification process is done through training a K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, and Stacking Ensemble algorithm, along with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Each algorithm can be found in its respective python file.

The graphical user interface was designed using Qt Designer.
